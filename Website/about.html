                    <h1>Hi, thank you for visiting my site.</h1>

                    <p>From military veteran to software engineer, this is the story of my journey and how I was able to acheive my dream through
                        hard work, determination, and a little push from my friends and family along the way.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Joined the military directly out of high school and served my country proudly for 5+ years and through 2 different deployments
                        to the middle east. I returned with no clue as to what I wanted to do with my life, a similar story to a lot of returning veterans.
                        I went with what I knew and that was to do some sort of work with my hands, however I didn't have the experience so I enrolled in college
                        to gain experience and knowledge specifically for welding, before I was able to graduate I was offered a job building all aluminum boats for
                        the government, and eventually I would go on to lead a team in developing multi-million dollar vessels for the US Navy. My journey, however,
                        did no stop there, I was required to relocate to Arizona where my life took an unexpected turn, I worked for a door security company for a bit 
                        before going on to climb cell towers all before I found my way to working as an onsite contractor for Intel. I spent a couple years working at
                        Intel, helping to install, upgrade and maintain the equipment which helped in the manufacture of wafers.
                    </p>

                    <p>This was not what I wanted to do, see, the whole time I was working I always had this curiosity for coding/programming. I knew nothing about it
                        but what I had seen in the movies, but it intrigued me. This was something that was not going to be the same and it was going to challenge me everyday
                        to do my best. Unfortunately, as with life, I was not able to pursue this path right away and instead I did what a lot of us do, and I put my family
                        before my desires. Once I was given the opportunity to pursue this passion of mine, my family was behind me 100% even with the added stress that would
                        come along with it. It is because of them, that I am here today and bringing you these type of products.
                    </p>

                    <p>Thank you for visiting and thank you for taking the time to make it this far, I hope that you enjoy what I have presented for you.
